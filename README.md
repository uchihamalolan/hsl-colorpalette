# hsl-colorpalette
A Color Palette Generated with CSS Variables &amp; HSL (referred from Ant Colours)

On Every Color Group
- A base hue value (0 - 360) is chosen
- Saturation is kept at 100%
- Brightness (Lightness) is altered to get a color-palette

Note: Also Added tooltip to inspect the `hsl` value applied and corresponding ant-colors color (in `rgb hex`)
